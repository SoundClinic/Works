<h1>Quote: </h1>
<p1>People should either be caressed or iznichtozhat, because of the evil little man can take revenge, but for large - can not;
   which implies that the offense caused to a person have to be calculated so as not to be afraid of retaliation. (с)Niccolo Machiavelli</p1>

<h1>Lermontov, The Dagger</h1>
<p2>I like you well, O trusty dagger mine,<br>
My comrade wrought of cool Damascus steel!<br>
Forged were you by the Georgian with revenge in the mind,<br>
By the Circassian free - for war were you made keen.<br>
A lily-white hand it was gave you to me -<br>
You were affection's keepsake, its last gift...<br>
Not blood, but pearl-like tears born of the agony<br>
Of bitter parting down your blade ran swift.<br>
<br>
Her dark eyes rested, full of secret pain,<br>
Of sadness and of mystery, upon<br>
My face, and like yourself when lit by flickering flame,<br>
Now clouded and turned dull, now glowed and shone.<br>
<br>
O dagger, love's mute pledge, you will my true<br>
Friend stay, and an example set to me, a wanderer:<br>
For faithful, yes, and firm of soul like you<br>
I'll be like you that tempered was by fire.</p2>
<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p3><div>
I need some sleep<br>
It can't go on like this<br>
I tried counting sheep<br>
But there's one I always miss<br>
Everyone says I'm getting down too low<br>
Everyone says you just gotta let it go<br>
You just gotta let it go<br>
You just gotta let it go<br>
<br>
I need some sleep<br>
Time to put the old horse down<br>
I'm in too deep<br>
And the wheels keep spinning 'round<br>
Everyone says I'm getting' down too low<br>
Everyone says you just gotta let it go<br>
You just gotta let it go<br>
You just gotta let it go<br>
<br>
You just gotta let it go<br>
</div></p3>
